FreeSurfer surface files are in:
[B]: /home/hamid/fs/x

The format of the subject session in [A] is: BOF112_BioFINDER2_<ID-date>
The format of the subject session in [B] is: _subject_id_BOF112_BioFINDER2_<ID-date>

For matching IDs, the dates are not the same. Since MRI and PET images are not acquired on the same day; sometimes days, weeks, or months apart. I have used a strategy to properly match tau sessions to closest MRI session. Then the PET image is registered to the MRI image. Then we use the MRI-based brain surfaces to build a surface representation of the PET image.      

The tau-PET files are in:
[A]: /home/hamid/alicia/tau

The folder for each subject contains 3 files:
[1] lh.suvrat_vox_mean_time_average_1.reslicedToMatchFSRib.subject.gii
[2] rh.suvrat_vox_mean_time_average_1.reslicedToMatchFSRib.subject.gii
[3] lhrh.suvrat_vox_mean_time_average_1.reslicedToMatchFSRib.subject.matching_surfdir.txt

[1] and [2] are the tau PET files projected on the lh and rh surfaces, respectively. The path to the subjects surface directory is given in [3]. 

There are 1255 subjects. You will use only a subset of them. Only those that are "tau positive" (T+) based on a threshold. Specifically, use any subject that has a tauPET > 1.36. tauPET values are given in BF2_1365.txt. This will result in around 300 subjects. You can group these subjects based on there diagnosis:
-Normal
-MCI
-AD

You can further split the Normal/SCD group to A+ and A- using variable abnormalAmyCSF (1: A+, 0: A-). Most of the T+ subjects should be A+, and, therefore, your Normal A- will be quite small. The vast majority of MCI are A+, especially if you only look at T+. AD are all A+.  

Thus, your groups will be: 
Normal A- T+
Normal A+ T+
MCI A- T+
MCI A+ T+
AD A+ T+

And best to also skip "MCI A- T+" and "Normal A- T+" since this group is tricky to interpret. So you will only have 4 groups to compare:
Normal A- T-
Normal A+ T-
Normal A+ T+
MCI    A+ T+
AD     A+ T+
